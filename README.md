# Coffee Machine

The Coffee Machine project is a Python-based program that emulates the functionality of a coffee machine. It allows users to select and order different types of coffee drinks, manage ingredient inventory, handle payments, and provides a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Menu Selection**: Users can choose their desired coffee drink from a menu that includes options like espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The program guides the user through the selection process.
- **Ingredient Management**: The coffee machine keeps track of the inventory of ingredients required to make each drink. It checks the availability of ingredients and informs the user if any ingredient is insufficient.
- **Payment Handling**: The program accepts payments in the form of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) and calculates the total amount. It verifies if the payment is sufficient and provides change if necessary.
- **Inventory Reporting**: Users can request a report that displays the current inventory of ingredients and the total amount of money collected by the coffee machine.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The program provides a user-friendly interface that prompts the user for input, displays messages and notifications, and guides the user through the ordering and payment process.
